# readme for SchedulingAlgorithms project


This project was made to test how different scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Serve and Shortest Remaining Time etc would handle a range
of datasets containing a number of processes with different arrival times and execution sizes and examine the results they produced

please refer to the 2 gantt charts provided to help visualize how each algorithm is sheduling the processes 



**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Open the Scheduling folder and paste any required datefiles needed for testing(2 have already been provided)

2. Open cmd in the folder Scheduling

3. Type javac A1.java

4. Type java A1 *datafile.txt*

examples
java A1 datafile1.txt
java A1 datafile2.txt


**RESULTS**

explaination of results:
the results will display each time the scheduling algorithm switched over to a different process while executing
the results will also display the average turnaround time and waiting time for each indiviual process
